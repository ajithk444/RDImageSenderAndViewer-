# RDImageSenderAndViewer
Angular project that allows an operator to send Dicom images of patients being tested for Diabetic Retinopathy to logged in ofthalmologist. The ofthalmologist will be able to view the Dicom images (in progress) and give  his/her verdict. The project uses firebase authentication, firestore, storage and remote config (soon).
