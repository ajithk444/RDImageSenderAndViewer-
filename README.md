# RDImageSenderAndViewer
Angular project that allows an administrator to send Dicom images of patients being tested for Diabetic Retinopathy and assign them to an ofthalmologist (that has being given an account).
<br>
The ofthalmologist will be able to view the Dicom images, have useful tools (Scroll, WindowLevel and ZoomAndPan), get some relevant DICOM tags and give  his/her verdict. 
<hr>
The project uses <a =href"https://github.com/ivmartel/dwv">ivmartel/dwv</a>, materialize css and firebase authentication, firestore, storage and remote config (soon).
